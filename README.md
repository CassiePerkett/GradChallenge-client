Hey Yat, Welcome to my client side. 

A bit of background, I struggled connecting my client side with my server. 

1. I tried the v3 of Apollo client (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/)
2. Then i tried using apollo-link-rest (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/links/rest/), but i was getting confused on how to implement the getPost on server side as well as the queries.
3. I think maybe I should have tried v2 of Apollo client and apollo basics. I think that might work but because my client couldnt connect I just hard coded my front end.
